# Initiating Peer Connection

## Description

As an initiator, you can establish a connection with another user to enable collaborative budget management. This allows you to share your financial data and manage budgets together.

## Flow

### 1. Starting Connection

- Open the "Peers" screen
- Click the "Connect to peer" button
- Share the generated connection code with the user you want to connect with

### 2. Waiting for Connection

- Wait for the other user to enter the connection code
- Once connected, you'll see a prompt to accept the other user's data
- Review the user's information and decide whether to accept or reject

### 3. After Connection

- If accepted:
  - The other user appears in your peers list
  - You can start sharing your financial data
  - You'll see when the peer is online/offline
- If rejected:
  - The connection is terminated
  - You can try connecting again later

### 4. Managing Connection
